        <Intro>The following letter was introduced in Wilde's libel trial by <person ref="Wilde_E">sir Edward Clark,
            Wilde</person>'s attorney. Although the letter lends support to the defense case, <person ref="Wilde_E">Clark</person> chose to
            introduce the letter to prevent the defense from introducing the letter in a more
            dramatic fashion during its case.</Intro>

        <P> My Own Boy,</P>
        <P>Your sonnet is quite lovely, and it is a marvel that those <description color="red-roseleaf">red-roseleaf lips</description> of yours
            should be made no less for the madness of music and song than for the madness of
            kissing. Your slim gilt soul walks between passion and poetry. I know <god mythical="Greek">Hyacinthus</god>, whom
            <god mythical="Greek">Apollo</god> loved so madly, was you in Greek days. Why are you alone in
                <location where="Europe">London</location>, and when do you go to <location>Salisbury</location>?
            Do go there to cool your hands in the grey twilight of Gothic things, and come here
            whenever you like. It is a lovely place and lacks only you; but go to
                <location where="Europe">Salisbury</location> first.</P>
        <P>Always, with <emotion feeling="love">undying love</emotion>,</P>
        <P>Yours, <person ref="Oscar">Oscar</person></P>
