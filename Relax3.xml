        <Intro>The following letter was introduced in Wilde's libel trial by <person>sir Edward Clark,
            Wilde</person>'s attorney. Although the letter lends support to the defense case, Clark chose to
            introduce the letter to prevent the defense from introducing the letter in a more
            dramatic fashion during its case.</Intro>

        <P> My Own Boy,</P>
        <P>Your sonnet is quite lovely, and it is a marvel that those red-roseleaf lips of yours
            should be made no less for the madness of music and song than for the madness of
            kissing. Your slim gilt soul walks between passion and poetry. I know Hyacinthus, whom
            Apollo loved so madly, was you in Greek days. Why are you alone in
                <location>London</location>, and when do you go to <location>Salisbury</location>?
            Do go there to cool your hands in the grey twilight of Gothic things, and come here
            whenever you like. It is a lovely place and lacks only you; but go to
                <location>Salisbury</location> first.</P>
        <P>Always, with undying love,</P>
        <P>Yours, <person>Oscar</person></P>
    </body>
